# My_First_project
The business problem tackled here is trying to improve customer 
service for YourCabs, a cab company in Bangalore. 
The problem of interest is booking cancellations by the company 
due to unavailability of a car. The challenge is that cancellations 
can occur very close to the trip start time, thereby causing 
passengers inconvenience.

The goal of the project is to create a predictive model for  classifying new bookings as to whether they will eventually gets  cancelled due to car unavailability
